## Bill of Materials - DRAFT

This document is a work in progress and is based on the current state
of the M45 public release. It does not match the earlier as-is STL
files. It may still contain known or unknown omissions. In particular,
the electronics/wiring is not covered, and general-purpose fastners
have not been counted.

This version of the BOM still uses the original 550 mm vertical
extrusion length. A future version may switch to 600 mm which will
require +100 mm adjustments to belt lengths and +50 mm adjustments to
CPAP hose lengths.
