# M45 AWD delta printer

This repository holds the current state of the M45 public release. It
is still incomplete, lacking some of the latest effector parts, all
parts related to controller board mounting and wire management, and
other small "quality of life" parts, and any sort of build
instructions, but it should be sufficient for a determined person with
experience building printers to build from. Further CAD, BOM details,
and instructions will be added as they are finished.

As a source repository, thus only includes and tracks the OpenSCAD
source files. Snapshots/releases with automatically generated STLs
will be added once a workflow for generation has been set up.
